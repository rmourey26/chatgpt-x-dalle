# chatgpt-x-dalle (CXD)

## CXD combines two of the best AI tools currently available - OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALLE - into one simple, easy to use app. Within seconds, users can toggle between 4 AI models including ChatGPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-3, CODEX, and of course DALLE image generator. The app also provides a great starting point for developers looking to build openai integrated software and applications. Please keep in mind that this is not a production level application and may contain issues/bugs. The app presently utilizes an Express server and a mixture of HTML and JS on the client side.
